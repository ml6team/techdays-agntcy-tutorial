# CoffeeAgntcy Workshop: Multi-Agent System Integration

Welcome to the **CoffeeAgntcy Workshop**! This interactive exercise will guide you through deploying and exploring a multi-agent coffee trading system and challenge you to integrate weather awareness into the Vietnam farm agent.

---

## 🏗️ System Overview

The CoffeeAgntcy system models a **supervisor-worker agent ecosystem**:

- **Coffee Exchange (Supervisor)**: Manages inventory and fulfills orders
- **Coffee Farms (Workers)**: Supply inventory and process orders
  - Brazil Farm: Basic coffee production
  - Colombia Farm: Uses weather data for yield calculations
  - Vietnam Farm: **Your integration target** – needs monsoon awareness
- **Weather MCP Server**: Provides real-time weather data
- **SLIM Message Bus**: Enables agent communication
- **Observability Stack**: Grafana dashboard for monitoring

---

## 🚀 Part 1: Deploy the System

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have these tools installed:

- **uv** (Python package manager)
```sh
brew install uv
````

* **Node.js** (16.14.0+)

```sh
node -v
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**
   
Create a virtual env:
```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Copy the environment file:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. **Configure LLM Provider**
   
You can choose between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. Edit your `.env` file:


 *OpenAI:*
 
 ```env
  LLM_PROVIDER=openai
  OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
  OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1 # Default OpenAI endpoint without proxy
  OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
 ```

 *Azure OpenAI:*
 
 ```env
  LLM_PROVIDER=azure-openai
  AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-azure-resource.openai.azure.com/
  AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4-prod
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview
 
 ```
3. **Configure Observability (OTEL)**

```env
OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

4. **Configure SLIM Message Bus**

```env
DEFAULT_MESSAGE_TRANSPORT=SLIM
TRANSPORT_SERVER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:46357
```

5. **Install Dependencies**

```sh
uv sync
```

6. **Start Services** (Each in a separate terminal tab)

> **Note:** Export the `PYTHONPATH` **on each new terminal** before running Python services. Also, don't forget to **activate your virtual environment**.
>
>```sh
>cd coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo
>source .venv/bin/activate
>export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
>```

* **Terminal 1 – SLIM Message Bus & Observability**

```sh
docker-compose up slim nats clickhouse-server otel-collector grafana
```

* **Terminal 2 – Weather MCP Server**

```sh
uv run python agents/mcp_servers/weather_service.py
```

* **Terminal 3 – Brazil Farm**

```sh
uv run python agents/farms/brazil/farm_server.py
```

* **Terminal 4 – Colombia Farm**

```sh
uv run python agents/farms/colombia/farm_server.py
```

* **Terminal 5 – Vietnam Farm**

```sh
uv run python agents/farms/vietnam/farm_server.py
```

* **Terminal 6 – Coffee Exchange**

```sh
uv run python agents/supervisors/auction/main.py
```

* **Terminal 7 – Frontend UI**

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If during the exercise you need to update one of the services, just stop the process and rerun it! 

### Access the System

* **Coffee Exchange UI**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). (the specific port is displayed on the frontend UI terminal, in case this one does not work)
* **Grafana Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (default admin/admin)

## 🔍 Part 2: Explore the System

### Test Current Functionality

Try these prompts in the UI:

| Intent          | Prompt                                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Check inventory | "How much coffee does the Colombia farm have?"                 |
| Check all farms | "Show me the total inventory across all farms"                 |
| Place an order  | "I need 50 lb of coffee beans from Colombia for \$0.50 per lb" |
| Vietnam farm    | "What's the current inventory at the Vietnam farm?"            |

### Visualize OTEL Traces in Grafana

1. Open Grafana: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
   Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`

2. Connect/Add ClickHouse datasource if needed:

   * **Server address:** `clickhouse-server`
   * **Port:** `9000`
   * **Protocol:** `native`
   * **User/Password:** `admin` / `admin`

3. Import the OTEL traces dashboard:
   Use [`lungo_dashboard.json`](lungo_dashboard.json) and select `grafana-clickhouse-datasource`.

4. Explore traces generated by agent interactions, including future monsoon-aware Vietnam farm requests.

## 🎯 Part 3: Challenge – Vietnam Farm Monsoon Integration

### Current Issue

The Vietnam farm currently does not query weather data. During monsoon season, yield reports are inaccurate, causing unfulfilled orders at the Coffee Exchange.

### Goals

1. **Enhance the Weather MCP Server**
   Implement monsoon detection in `agents/mcp_servers/weather_service.py`. The server should provide:

   * `monsoon_status`: True / False
   * Real-time weather metrics (e.g., wind speed, rainfall)

2. **Update the Vietnam Farm Agent**
   Modify `agents/farms/vietnam/agent.py` to:

   * Query the Weather MCP server for monsoon status before sending inventory data.
   * Reduce coffee yield by **30%** if a monsoon is detected.
   * Include monsoon status in inventory reports.

### Expected Behavior

* Monsoon status is displayed by the MCP server:
  `"There are monsoon conditions."` or `"There are no monsoons."`
* Adjusted yield if monsoon present (30% reduction)
* Real weather data from the MCP server (not hardcoded)
* Grafana shows traces of MCP calls

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1️⃣ Add Monsoon Detection to the Weather MCP Server

**File:** `agents/mcp_servers/weather_service.py`

- **Implement the following function:**

  ```python
  async def get_monsoon_status(location: str):
      # 1. Retrieve weather forecast (see get_forecast for example)
      # 2. If wind speed > 8 m/s, consider it monsoon season
      # 3. Return a descriptive message with wind speed
      # 4. Handle errors gracefully
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ Integrate MCP Client in the Vietnam Farm Agent

**File:** `agents/farms/vietnam/agent.py`

- **Implement the monsoon check node:**

  ```python
  async def _monsoon_check_node(self, state: GraphState) -> dict:
      # 1. Initialize AGNTCY factory
      # 2. Create transport for MCP communication
      # 3. Create MCP client connected to the weather server
      # 4. Call get_monsoon_status asynchronously
      # 5. Extract concise status line:
      #    "There are monsoon conditions." or "There are no monsoon conditions."
      # 6. Return updated state with monsoon_status
  ```

- **Update the agent workflow:**
  - Ensure the supervisor node routes inventory queries through the monsoon check node.
  - In `_build_graph`, add the new node and edges as needed.

- **Update the inventory node:**
  - Modify `_inventory_node` to use `monsoon_status` from the state.
  - Adjust yield estimates: **reduce by 30% if monsoon detected**.
  - Include the monsoon status line in the AI prompt.

> **Note:**  
> The UI does not update automatically. To see your changes reflected, run the following from the `frontend` folder:
> ```sh
> cp frontend/src/utils/graphConfigs_workshop.tsx frontend/src/utils/graphConfigs.tsx
> ```

---

### 3️⃣ Test Your Implementation

- **Try these example messages:**
  - `"How much coffee do we have in stock?"`
  - `"What’s the status of order 12345?"`

- **Verify:**
  - `_monsoon_check_node` queries the MCP server
  - Inventory responses include monsoon status
  - Yield is adjusted correctly for monsoon
  - Order queries still function as before

---

## 💡 Hints & Tips

* Use `async/await` for MCP calls
* Use logging to debug monsoon responses (very handy!)
* Ensure supervisor routes inventory queries through monsoon node
* Keep LLM prompts concise to limit output to required info

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

* ✅ Vietnam farm reports actual monsoon status
* ✅ Coffee yield adjusted based on weather
* ✅ Weather data retrieved from MCP server
* ✅ Grafana traces show Vietnam farm MCP interactions
* ✅ Existing functionality remains intact

---

## 🎉 Next Steps

* Extend weather awareness to other farms
* Include additional weather parameters
* Use Grafana to monitor agent communication and performance
* Experiment with prompts to observe system responses

**Happy coding!** 🚀☕

Focus not just on making it work, but understanding how multi-agent systems integrate external services and communicate effectively.
